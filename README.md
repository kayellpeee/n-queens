#n-queens

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. This project was worked
on with a pair; it's representative of the kind of problems that I've tackled,
but not of my solo work.


*After working on this, I spent some time exploring the problem on my own.
See the solo branch/[this post](http://www.keenanlidralporter.com/n-queens/)
to see what I worked on
